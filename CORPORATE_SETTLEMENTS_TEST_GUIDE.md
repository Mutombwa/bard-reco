# 🚀 CORPORATE SETTLEMENTS - QUICK TEST GUIDE

## ✅ All Fixes Applied - Ready to Test!

## 🎯 What Changed

### 1. Import Progress Bar ✅
- **Before**: Jumped 5% → 100%
- **Now**: Smooth 10% → 30% → 60% → 80% → 95% → 100%

### 2. Batch 1 Logic ✅  
- **Before**: Only FD = FC (missed reference check)
- **Now**: FD = FC **AND** Same Reference (true perfect matches)

### 3. Calculations ✅
- **Before**: Inconsistent percentage base
- **Now**: Uses LARGER amount as denominator (professional standard)

### 4. Results Display ✅
- **Now includes**: Variance % and Amount for Batches 2, 3, 4

## 🧪 Quick Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Perfect Match (Batch 1)
Create test data:
```
Reference: REF001
FD: 1000.00
FC: 1000.00
```
**Expected**: ✅ Goes to Batch 1 (Perfect Match)

---

### Test 2: FD Greater (Batch 2)
Create test data:
```
Reference: REF002
FD: 1050.00
FC: 1000.00
Difference: 50 (4.76%)
```
**Expected**: 📈 Goes to Batch 2 (FD > FC within 7%)
**Should show**: Variance 4.76%, Amount 50.00

---

### Test 3: FC Greater (Batch 3)
Create test data:
```
Reference: REF003
FD: 1000.00
FC: 1060.00
Difference: 60 (5.66%)
```
**Expected**: 📉 Goes to Batch 3 (FC > FD within 7%)
**Should show**: Variance 5.66%, Amount 60.00

---

### Test 4: High Difference (Batch 4)
Create test data:
```
Reference: REF004
FD: 1000.00
FC: 1150.00
Difference: 150 (13.04%)
```
**Expected**: ⚠️ Goes to Batch 4 (Same Ref, over 7%)
**Should show**: Variance 13.04%, Amount 150.00

---

### Test 5: Single Transaction (Batch 5)
Create test data:
```
Reference: REF005 (only one transaction with this reference)
FD: 500.00
FC: 0.00
```
**Expected**: ❌ Goes to Batch 5 (Unmatched/Single)

---

## 📋 Full Test Workflow

### Step 1: Launch App
```batch
LAUNCH_APP.bat
```

### Step 2: Navigate
- Click "Corporate Settlements" from main menu

### Step 3: Import
1. Click "📁 Import Settlement File"
2. Select your test Excel/CSV file
3. **Watch progress bar**: Should show 10%, 30%, 60%, 80%, 95%, 100%
4. Verify file info displays correctly

### Step 4: Configure
1. Check column auto-detection worked
2. If not, manually select:
   - Foreign Debits column
   - Foreign Credits column
   - Reference column
3. Verify tolerance = 0.5
4. Verify percentage threshold = 7.0%

### Step 5: Reconcile
1. Click "⚡ Start Reconciliation"
2. Watch progress (should show X/Y groups)
3. Wait for completion message

### Step 6: Verify Results
Check batch distribution makes sense:
- ✅ **Batch 1**: Should have perfect FD=FC matches with same refs
- 📈 **Batch 2**: Should have FD > FC within 7%
- 📉 **Batch 3**: Should have FC > FD within 7%
- ⚠️ **Batch 4**: Should have same ref but >7% difference
- ❌ **Batch 5**: Should have singles or unmatched

### Step 7: View Details
1. Click "👁️ View Detailed Results"
2. Check each batch tab
3. Verify transactions are in correct batches
4. For Batches 2, 3, 4: Check variance columns appear

### Step 8: Export
1. Click "📊 Export to Excel"
2. Choose location
3. Wait for export (should show progress)
4. File should auto-open
5. Verify:
   - Summary sheet has correct counts
   - All_Batches sheet has clear separators
   - Batch headers are descriptive
   - Individual batch sheets exist
   - Variance columns present in Batches 2, 3, 4

---

## 🔍 What to Look For

### ✅ Success Indicators:
- Import progress shows all stages (not just 5% and 100%)
- Batch 1 only contains FD=FC with same reference
- Batch 2-4 show variance information
- Export has proper batch headers
- All percentages calculated consistently

### ❌ Issues to Report:
- Progress bar still jumps
- Batch 1 contains mismatched references
- Variance calculations seem wrong
- Export formatting unclear
- Missing batch separators

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Accurate Testing:
1. Use simple test data first (10-20 rows)
2. Include examples of each batch type
3. Verify calculations manually for a few records
4. Test with real data after test data passes

### Common Test Data Template:
```csv
Reference,Foreign_Debits,Foreign_Credits
REF001,1000.00,1000.00      # Batch 1
REF002,1050.00,1000.00      # Batch 2 (5%)
REF003,1000.00,1060.00      # Batch 3 (6%)
REF004,1000.00,1150.00      # Batch 4 (15%)
REF005,500.00,0.00          # Batch 5 (single)
REF006,2000.00,2000.00      # Batch 1
REF007,3000.00,3100.00      # Batch 3 (3.33%)
```

## 📊 Expected Results for Test Data Above:

| Batch | Count | Transactions |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| Batch 1 | 2 | REF001, REF006 |
| Batch 2 | 1 | REF002 |
| Batch 3 | 2 | REF003, REF007 |
| Batch 4 | 1 | REF004 |
| Batch 5 | 1 | REF005 |

**Total**: 7 transactions across 5 batches
