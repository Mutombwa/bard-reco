# üîß Phase 2 Method Error - FIXED

## Issue
```
AttributeError: 'FNBWorkflowPage' object has no attribute '_get_amount_from_row'
```

## Root Cause
Phase 2 code was using a non-existent helper method `_get_amount_from_row()` that doesn't exist in the FNBWorkflowPage class.

## Fix Applied ‚úÖ

### Changed Code (Lines ~10645-10676)

**Before (BROKEN)**:
```python
# Get target amount from ledger
target_amount = self._get_amount_from_row(ledger_row, debit_ledger, credit_ledger, is_ledger=True)

# Get statement amount
stmt_amt = self._get_amount_from_row(stmt_row, None, None, is_ledger=False, amount_col=amt_statement)
```

**After (FIXED)**:
```python
# Get target amount from ledger (same logic as Phase 1 indexing)
target_amount = 0
if amt_ledger_debit and amt_ledger_debit in ledger.columns:
    target_amount = abs(ledger_row[amt_ledger_debit])
elif amt_ledger_credit and amt_ledger_credit in ledger.columns:
    target_amount = abs(ledger_row[amt_ledger_credit])

# Get statement amount (direct column access like Phase 1)
stmt_amt = 0
if amt_statement and amt_statement in statement.columns:
    stmt_amt = abs(stmt_row[amt_statement])
```

## What Changed
- Replaced non-existent method calls with direct column access
- Mirrors the same pattern used in Phase 1 (lines ~10439-10443)
- Uses absolute values for consistent amount comparisons
- Handles both debit and credit columns properly

## Testing Status
- ‚úÖ Syntax validation: No errors
- ‚è≥ Runtime test: Restart app and re-run reconciliation

## Action Required
**Restart the application** and run the reconciliation again. The AttributeError should be resolved.
