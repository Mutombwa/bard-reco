## 🧪 Local Testing (Optional but Recommended)

Test the app locally before deploying:

```bash
# Make sure you're in the project directory
cd streamlit-app

# Run the app
streamlit run app.py

# Test these features:
# 1. Login with admin credentials
# 2. Try registering with @bardsantner.com ✅
# 3. Try registering with other domain ❌ (should fail)
# 4. Upload sample Excel file
# 5. Run reconciliation
# 6. Export results
```

**App URL**: http://localhost:8501

## 💡 Deployment Tips

### Before Pushing to GitHub
```bash
# Check what will be committed
git status

# Review changes
git diff

# Ensure data/ folder is ignored
ls .gitignore
```

### Streamlit Cloud Settings
- **Repository**: Private (recommended)
- **Branch**: main
- **Python version**: 3.11 (automatic from .python-version)
- **Main file**: app.py
- **Requirements**: requirements.txt (automatic)

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Package not found" Error
**Cause**: Typo in requirements.txt or package unavailable
**Solution**: Verify package names match PyPI exactly

### "Python version mismatch" Warning
**Cause**: .python-version file missing or wrong version
**Solution**: Ensure `.python-version` contains `3.11`

### "Import Error" on Deployment
**Cause**: Package missing from requirements.txt
**Solution**: All packages verified ✅ (shouldn't happen!)

### App is Slow on First Load
**Cause**: Cold start on Streamlit Cloud
**Solution**: Normal behavior, subsequent loads are fast

---

## 📊 Performance Expectations

### Deployment Time
- **Code push to GitHub**: 10-30 seconds
- **Streamlit Cloud build**: 2-3 minutes
- **Total time to live app**: ~3 minutes

### App Performance
- **Initial load**: 3-5 seconds (cold start)
- **Subsequent loads**: <1 second
- **File upload**: Depends on size (max 200MB)
- **Reconciliation**: Depends on dataset size
  - Small (100 rows): 1-2 seconds
  - Medium (1,000 rows): 5-10 seconds
  - Large (10,000 rows): 30-60 seconds

### Resource Usage (Free Tier)
- **RAM**: 1 GB available
- **CPU**: Shared resources
- **Storage**: Ephemeral (resets on redeploy)
