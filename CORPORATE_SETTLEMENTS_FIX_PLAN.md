## Date: 2025-10-09

## Issues Identified & Fixed:

### 1. **Import Progress Bar** ✅
- **Problem**: Progress jumps from 5% to 100% instantly
- **Fix**: Added proper progress tracking through import stages

  - Batch 3: FC > FD within 7% threshold
  - Batch 4: Same reference, difference >7%
  - Batch 5: Different references or single transactions

### 4. **Calculations** ✅
